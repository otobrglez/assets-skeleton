# Talk Backbone.js and TDD with CoffeeScript.

## We will build "list of tools"

- Simple list that holds list of tools.
- RESTful API
- UI with JS





## Lets use REST for API
- Representational State Transfer
- RESTful web service
- Imlemented using HTTP and the principles of REST

## How **should** the tool behave






## Implementation of tool






## How **should** the tools endpoint behave






## Implementation of controller






## Perfect API.
- Full test covarage
- Obays standards
- Can be used from *everywhere* by *anyone*





## Think...
- about your site as another client
- about providing smoth experience to end-user
- about testing?





## Backbone.js
- is framework for building JavaScript apps
- provides Models, Views, Controllers and Events
- provides structure
- has some convetions
- logic decupling





## No f* way. JS is f* pain.
- I know.





## CoffeScrip to rescue.
**CoffeeScript** is a little language that COMPILES into JavaScript. Underneath all those awkward braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.





## JS Sucks example: How would JS for this look like?
- Person has first_name, last_name
- Student class inherites from Person
- Student has index property





## Sucky example by hand






## Example in CoffeScript






## Backbone.js - Dependency
- Underscore.js





## Underscore.js
//us_coffee





## Backbone breakdown.
- Models
- Collections
- Router
- Events
- * Validation
